== Description ==

Accept **all major cards, Apple Pay**, and **PayPal** directly with PayPal Braintree for WooCommerce. Customers can save their card details or link a PayPal account for an even faster checkout experience.

= Safe and secure — every time =

Braintree's secure Hosted Fields provide a **seamless** way for customers to enter payment info on your site without redirecting them to PayPal.

It's [PCI compliant](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Understanding_SAQs_PCI_DSS_v3.pdf) and supports **SCA** and **3D Secure** verification, so you always meet security requirements — without sacrificing flexibility. Plus, Braintree’s [fraud tools](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/guides/fraud-tools/overview) protect your business by helping **detect and prevent fraud**.

= Even faster checkouts =

Customers can **save their credit and debit card details** or **link a PayPal account** to fast-forward checkout the next time they shop with you. Adding **PayPal Checkout** and **Buy Now** buttons to your product, cart, and checkout pages makes purchasing simpler and quicker, too.

Take charge of how you sell online. PayPal Braintree supports [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) — the perfect solution for earning **recurring revenue**. It's also compatible with [WooCommerce Pre-Orders](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/), enabling you to accept payment **upfront** or as products ship.
